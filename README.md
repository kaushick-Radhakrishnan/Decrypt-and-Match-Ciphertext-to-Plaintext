Decrypt and Match Ciphertext to Plaintext
This project implements a system to decrypt ciphertext and match it with its corresponding plaintext using machine learning techniques. The system takes encrypted messages and tries to match them with the correct plaintext form, allowing for efficient text analysis and decryption.

Overview
The project utilizes machine learning models trained on various ciphertext and plaintext pairs. 
It includes:
Decryption Model: A machine learning model that helps in matching the ciphertext with its corresponding plaintext.
Pre-trained Model: A saved model (finalized_model.sav) that has been trained to predict or match ciphertext with plaintext.
Vectorizer: A vectorizer.pickle file used for transforming the text data into numerical features that the model can work with.
Text Matching: The system matches the given ciphertext to the corresponding plaintext using a pre-trained machine learning model.

Key Features:
Pre-trained Model: Use a trained model to perform decryption and text matching.
Text Vectorization: Converts textual data into numerical format using vectorization for effective processing.
Machine Learning-Based: The system uses a machine learning model to improve the matching accuracy between ciphertext and plaintext.
Ready-to-Use: The project is designed to be plug-and-play with minimal setup.

How It Works
Preprocessing: The system reads the input ciphertext from a dataset (like test.csv).
Text Vectorization: The ciphertext is transformed into a numerical format using the vectorizer (vectorizer.pickle), which converts the text into feature vectors.
Model Prediction: The pre-trained model (finalized_model.sav) is loaded, and the system predicts the corresponding plaintext for the given ciphertext.
Matching: The predicted plaintext is compared to the expected plaintext (from the dataset), and the results are displayed.

Files Explained
app.py: The main script that loads the model and processes the input ciphertext to predict plaintext.
finalized_model.sav: The saved machine learning model that was trained to predict ciphertext-plaintext pairs.
plain_text_dict.var: A variable or dictionary file used to store or map plaintext information.
test.csv: A CSV file containing test data (ciphertext-plaintext pairs) to evaluate the model's performance.
vectorizer.pickle: A saved vectorizer object used to convert text data into numerical features before feeding them into the machine learning model.
requirements.txt: A list of Python dependencies required to run the project.
.gitattributes: Git LFS (Large File Storage) configuration for handling large files like the model or vectorizer.

Example Workflow
Prepare the test data: Ensure that your test.csv file contains pairs of ciphertext and expected plaintext.
Run app.py: The model will load, process the ciphertexts, and attempt to match them with the correct plaintext.
Output: The system will display the matched ciphertext and plaintext pairs, helping you analyze the model’s accuracy.
